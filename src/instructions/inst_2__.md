Before the experiment phase (see timeline at the top of this webpage), you will undergo two training phases:
<br>

ðŸŒŒ **Forcefield resistance training:** You will encounter spaceships protected by forcefields. Your objective here is to estimate the forcefield resistance of the spaceships indicated by color. <br><br>
  
ðŸš€ **Spaceship reward training:** You will encounter unprotected spaceships (i.e. without  forcefields). You have to focus on finding the most rewarding spaceship.
