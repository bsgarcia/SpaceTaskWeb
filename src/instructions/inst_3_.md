# Training 

### Before the main phase of the task described in the last panel, you will undergo two training phases:
  ðŸŒŒ **Forcefield resistance learning:**  You will encounter identical spaceships with varying forcefield colors. You have to focus on the forcefield mechanism, as spaceships won't provide any reward or points. <br>
  ðŸš€ **Spaceship reward learning:** You will encounter unprotected spaceships (i.e. without  forcefields). You have to focus finding the most rewarding spaceship.
