# ðŸŒŒ Learn Forcefield resistance! ðŸŒŒ

<br><br>

 In order to **earn points**, you will have to **learn forcefield resistance** by shooting at spaceships. You will encounter identical spaceships with **varying forcefield colors**. Your objective here is to **estimate the forcefield resistance** of the spaceships **indicated by color**. Said differently, there are **colors** that are offer more or less **resistance**. **Rewards** are fixed to **5**, so you can ignore them. Instead, focus whether the **forcefield** was **destroyed or not** (and whether or not you got the 5 points reward), and **which color** it was <br><br>
