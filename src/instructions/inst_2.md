# ðŸŒŒ Learn forcefields' resistance! ðŸŒŒ
 In order to **earn points**, you will have to **learn forcefield resistance** by shooting at spaceships (see picture on the right). All spaceships are **identicals**, what differs is the **resistance** of their **forcefield**. That resistance is **signaled** by the exact **color** of the forcefield. Forcefields can be weaker (or stronger) as their color vary from full <b style="color: cornflowerblue">blue</b> to full <b style="color: yellow">yellow</b>.
 Said differently, the color of a forcefield **signals** its **probability** of being **destroyed** by your shot.  When you **succeed** at destroying a forcefield, you will earn **5 points** - focus on **which color** it was so that you can maximize your points.
The optimal forcefield can be equally on the left or on the right, there is no optimal side.
