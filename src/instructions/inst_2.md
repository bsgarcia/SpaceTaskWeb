# ðŸŒŒ Learn forcefields' resistance! ðŸŒŒ

<br>

 In order to **earn points**, you will have to **learn forcefield resistance** by shooting at spaceships. You will encounter identical spaceships with **varying forcefield colors**. A forcefield can go from full <b style="color: cornflowerblue">blue</b> to full <b style="color: orangered">red</b>, with in between **blue-red proportions**. Your objective here is to **estimate the forcefield resistance** of the spaceships **indicated by color proportions**. This proportion codes for a **probability of destroying** the forcefield. Said differently, there are **color ratios** that offer (on average) more or less **resistance**. **Rewards** are fixed to **5**, so you can ignore them. Instead, focus on whether the **forcefield** was **destroyed or not** (and whether or not you got the 5 points reward), and **which color** it was. <br><br>
