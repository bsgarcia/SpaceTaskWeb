Well done! ðŸ˜ƒ <br>
Now let's continue with the next training.

# ðŸš€ Spaceship reward training ðŸš€
You will encounter **unprotected** spaceships (i.e. without  forcefields). You have to focus on finding the most rewarding spaceship within each pair. Said differently, each time you shoot a spaceship, it will provide a different reward. You have to learn which spaceship provides the **highest average reward**.
