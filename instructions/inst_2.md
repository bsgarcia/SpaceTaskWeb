# Your objective 
In this task, to maximize you overall score (displayed at the top left of the screen), there are two things you have to learn. <br>
ðŸŒŒ **Forcefield resistance:** Estimate the forcefield resistance of the spaceships indicated by color. Forcefields are randomly drawn at the beginning of each trial. 
<br>
ðŸš€**Spaceships' average rewards:** Learn the average reward of each spaceship. Each spaceship has a different average reward. 

You will face waves of spaceship pairs. 
In order to destroy a target, you have to press either left or right arrow key, and then press space to shoot, as demonstrated in the video on the right.
