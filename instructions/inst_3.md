# Training 

### Before the main phase of the task described in the last panel, you will undergo two training phases:
  * **Phase One:** Here you will encounter identical spaceships with varying forcefield colors. You have to focus on the forcefield mechanism, as spaceships won't provide any reward or points.
  * **Phase Two:** Here you will learn average rewards of different spaceships without  forcefields.
