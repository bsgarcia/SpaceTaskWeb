# Your objective 
In this task, to maximize you overall score, there are two things you have to learn. 
* **Spaceships' average rewards:** Learn the average reward of each spaceship. Each spaceship has a different average reward. 
* **Forcefield resistance:** Estimate the forcefield resistance of the spaceships indicated by color. Forcefields are randomly drawn at the beginning of each trial. 

In order to destroy a target, you have to hit the left or right arrow key, and then press space to shoot, as demonstrated in the video on the right.
