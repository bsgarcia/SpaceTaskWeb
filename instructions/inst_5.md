# Learning Dimensions:

* **Value Dimension:** Learn the average reward of each spaceship.
* **Perceptual Dimension:** Estimate the forcefield resistance of the spaceships indicated by color.


**Task Challenges:**

- **Integration of Dimensions:** The final reward depends on both the value of the spaceship chosen and the likelihood that its forcefield will be destroyed, expressed by the forcefield's color.
- **Design Parameters:** The task design is based on simulations to optimize difficulty and learning.

**Task Structure:**

- **Sessions:** Each session includes two 25-trial blocks, each with different pairs of enemy spaceships and associated expected values.
- **Learning Episodes:** Experience two distinct learning episodes (hard-easy) regarding spaceship values.
- **Order of Blocks:** The order of these blocks will be randomized for each participant.

**Variability in Learning:**

- **Learning Difficulty:** Blocks will vary in difficulty by manipulating the difference in expected spaceship values.
- **Tradeoffs:** Fixed expected value learning blocks combined with randomly drawn forcefields will create value vs. perceptual tradeoffs, highlighting individual differences.

**Training Phases:**

- **Progressive Learning:** Before the main phase, you'll undergo two training phases:
  - **Phase One:** Encounter identical spaceships with varying forcefield colors for perceptual learning.
  - **Phase Two:** Learn expected values of different spaceships without displayed forcefields.

**Instructions:**

- Pay attention to spaceship values and forcefield colors.
- Make decisions based on maximizing rewards and minimizing losses.
- Your score will reflect the success of your decisions.

**Note:** Take your time to understand the learning mechanisms during training phases to perform better in the main task.

Enjoy the task, and let's begin!
