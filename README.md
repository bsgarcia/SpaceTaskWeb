# Reinforcement Learning Space Shooter
## Description

This project is a website involving a space shooter programmed with the unity game engine. The game is programmed in C# and is then transpiled to javascript (more specifically, WebGL), allowing for webpage integration. 

With this project we aimed at gamifying (as a way to ![promote subjects' engagement](https://games.jmir.org/2016/2/e11/)) dual bandit tasks, which most of time consist in left clicking on two items displayed on screen.
